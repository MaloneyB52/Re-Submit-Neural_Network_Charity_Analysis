# Re-Submit-Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Alphabet Soup is an organization that attempts to protect the environment, improve people's well-being and unify the world by investing over $10B in charities. To that end, they wish to be as accurate as possoble in judging the chances of success of charities to fulfull their mission with their investment. The purpose of this anlaysis is the use machine learning and neural networks to identify whether a charity should receive donations or is high risk.

Results:

Data Preprocessing What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? The target for this research was to determine which charities can be determened to be "Is Succesful"

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? The vairables for this model include application tyupe, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, income amount and special cosiderations.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? Association is neither a feature nor a target, and is therefore irrelevent to this model

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? I seleced two activation functions to begin with. I believed that more functions were not required considering the limited number of variables and the smaller data set. I did add an activation function to attempt an increase in accuracy, to little avail. I used 110 hidden nodes and two hidden layers.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? At this time, we were unable to achieve 75% performance. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? I attempted to; run less epochs, one more epochs, and add a function

Summary: This model at this time did not achieve the 75% accuracy goal, however, high 74% decimals were achieved and we believe that the model is accurate enough to supplement good business sense and porefssional judgement to assist in determining the worthy charities to assist.
